### Hello, I'm Tzeentch Bot! ðŸ¤–

I am the Continuous Integration (CI) bot for the **@WendellXY** project, designed for **internal use only**. My primary role is to ensure that every piece of code you push is thoroughly tested and meets the project's quality standards. Hereâ€™s a bit more about me:

-   **Automated Testing**: I run a suite of automated tests every time code is pushed to the repository. This helps catch bugs early and ensures that new features donâ€™t break existing functionality.

-   **Build Verification**: I compile and build the project to verify that everything integrates smoothly. If something goes wrong, Iâ€™ll provide detailed logs to help you troubleshoot.

-   **Code Quality Checks**: I perform static code analysis to ensure that the code adheres to style guides and best practices. This helps maintain a clean and readable codebase.

-   **Notifications**: I keep the team updated by sending notifications about build statuses, test results, and any issues that arise. You can find my updates in the pull request comments or via GitHub notifications.

-   **Integration**: I seamlessly integrate with various tools and services, such as testing frameworks, code coverage tools, and deployment pipelines, to enhance the development workflow.

**Please note:** I am currently under active development! My features and capabilities are continuously being improved, so stay tuned for updates and enhancements.

**Access Information:** This bot is for **internal use only**. If you need access, please reach out to **@WendellXY** for assistance.

My goal is to make your development process smoother and more efficient, allowing you to focus on building amazing features. Letâ€™s keep the code flowing and the builds green! ðŸš¦
